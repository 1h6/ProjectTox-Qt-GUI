If you would like Tox to save your chat history, it is encouraged that you also
instruct it to encrypt the files it saves.  Not doing so presents a security
risk as any party with access to these files will be able to read them otherwise.
Encrypting your logs will not guarantee security against directed attacks or
from having authorities demand you decrypt your history for them, but it will
protect you from many other risks such as having a virus steal your log files
to be read by an attacker.
